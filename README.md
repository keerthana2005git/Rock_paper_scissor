# Rock_paper_scissor
This C++ program simulates a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between the user and the computer. The user inputs a choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the computerâ€™s choice is generated randomly. The program compares both choices to determine the winner based on the standard rules and displays the result (win, lose, or tie).
